# PokemonMastersMPDLSU2021MEV
This is a project created for my introduction to programming class in De La Salle University for my Bachelors in Game Development Program. This is a Pokemon Masters inspired game programmed entirely in C that include a working shop, inventory/sync pair, and a battle arena with various stages and bosses.


In this game, you fight various random "trainers" with your own trainers classified as pairs in various stages, wherein each stage has its own mini boss. If you defeat the final boss, you win, but if you lose all your health and pairs, you lose. There are three types of pairs, strike, which deals damage, tech, which has a chance to skip the enemy's turn, and support, which heals the player. After defeating a trainer, you have the chance to save your progress and continue your current run. After defeating the final boss, there is a "New 
Game Plus" feature wherein you can do a whole new run and in addition enemies are stronger than previously, in order to enhance replayability.


Input keys are typed into the terminal, usually denoted by a bracket []. Unfortunately, some labels are also denoted with a label which is a design error. 


In this repository, uploaded is the .c file, the .dev file as the IDE used is DEVCPP, a compiled .exe to run, and a pdf document containing test scripts and their cases as required by the project's specifications.


This project merrited a perfect score by the instructor.
