# PokemonMastersMPDLSU2021MEV
This is a project created for my introduction to programming class in De La Salle University for my Bachelors in Game Development Program. This is a Pokemon Masters inspired game programmed entirely in C that include a working shop, inventory/sync pair, and a battle arena with various stages and bosses.
